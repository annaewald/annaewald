## Hi there, I'm Anna 👋

I am a mathematician (M.Sc.) and software engineer with a focus on data science and digitalization.
- Skills: Python, SQL, C++, Angular/TypeScript, machine learning, and astronomy data analysis with TOPCAT

Outside of code, I'm a pianist and electronic music producer (check my DJing on [RA](https://ra.co/dj/annar)), as well as a scuba diver and traveler.
